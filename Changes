     - changed to more generic authentication method which
       should work for basic, digest & NTLM
     - added some NTLM helpers
     - fleshed out some documentation
     - NB The more generic method will mean that in the basic case
       of using basic auth it will now do an initial HEAD that fails
       and then fall back to using auth information
